# ✦ Vibma

**Vibe Design meets Figma.**

Let AI agents design directly in Figma — read layouts, create components,
modify styles, and build entire design systems through conversation.

## Prerequisites

Vibma works with any LLM that supports MCP, but only **Claude Opus 4.6** 
consistently achieves the demonstrated results. GPT-5.3-Codex comes close 
but makes occasional mistakes.

## Setup

Two paths:

| | Guide | For |
|---|---|---|
| 📦 | [**DRAGME.md**](./DRAGME.md) | Clone the repo, build from source, full control |
| ☁️ | [**CARRYME.md**](./CARRYME.md) | Install from npm, zero cloning |

Or just paste this to your AI agent and let it figure it out:

```
Set up Vibma so I can vibe-design in Figma.
Follow the instructions at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ufira-ai/vibma/refs/heads/main/CARRYME.md
```

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ufira-ai/vibma/issues) — bugs and feature requests

Vibma is the first open-source project from **[ufira](https://github.com/ufira-ai)** — a platform bridging creators and technology. We believe everyone who wants to create should have access to AI-powered tools, not just developers.
